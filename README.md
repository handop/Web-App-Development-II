<h1>Tristate Music Web Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This web application acts as a hub for people in the music community hosting music events. Users can create profiles, schedule music events, and like and rate other user's events. Both User Profiles and Events have image galleries, where users can upload images such as flyers, concert pictures, or any images that best represent the music. 

All the web page formatting and design was written in HTML5 and CSS. Most of the page functionality was written in C#, with some Ajax for the rating and like systems. The whole website is supported by an SQL database that holds user accounts, event info, and all images.
