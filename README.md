<h1>Tristate Music Web Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This web application was supposed to serve as a hub for music events and concerts for people to make and discover. Users can create and update their profile information and profile picture, create a personal image gallery, and even create and plan their own events. Once the form is filled out and submitted, the event shows up on the home page for everyone to see. In addition, all registered users can like and rate other member's events. The front-end design and formatting was written with HTML and CSS in such a way that the website works both on PCs and mobile devices. The bulk of the website functionality was written with C#, and some Ajax to handle the like and rating systems. The whole website was supported by a relational database built with SQL.
